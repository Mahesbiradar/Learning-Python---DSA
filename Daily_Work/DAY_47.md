### 5. Merge Two Sorted Lists (LC 21)

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`.

Merge the two lists into one **sorted** list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return *the head of the merged linked list*.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in both lists is in the range `[0, 50]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- Both `list1` and `list2` are sorted in **non-decreasing** order.

### 8. Maximum Twin Sum of a Linked List (LC 2130)

In a linked list of size `n`, where `n` is **even**, the `ith` node (**0-indexed**) of the linked list is known as the **twin** of the `(n-1-i)th` node, if `0 <= i <= (n / 2) - 1`.

* For example, if `n = 4`, then node `0` is the twin of node `3`, and node `1` is the twin of node `2`. These are the only nodes with twins for `n = 4`.

The **twin sum** is defined as the sum of a node and its twin.

Given the `head` of a linked list with even length, return *the **maximum twin sum** of the linked list*.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: head = [5,4,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation:
Nodes 0 and 1 are the twins of nodes 3 and 2, respectively. All have twin sum = 6.
There are no other nodes with twins in the linked list.
Thus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is 6.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: head = [4,2,2,3]
Output: 7
Explanation:
The nodes with twins present in the linked list are:
- Node 0 is the twin of node 3 having a twin sum of 4 + 3 = 7.
- Node 1 is the twin of node 2 having a twin sum of 2 + 2 = 4.
Thus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is max(7, 4) = 7.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: head = [1,100000]
Output: 100001
Explanation:
There is only one node with a twin in the linked list having twin sum of 1 + 100000 = 100001.
```

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the list is an **even** integer in the range `[2, 10^5]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
